# "Elderly Falling Detection"

A concept project for elderly saftely walking.

## "description"

Tracking and angle detecting of a Walking stick.

The project split to two main parts:

- Image Proccesing - using hough transform and other CV's technics, I created a line detecting in space. The system will track a specific line and calculates it's angle.
- Robotics - using PID controll technic, I programmed a robot to track the line.
